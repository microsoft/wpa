Description: Opinionated functions that enable easier and faster
    analysis of Workplace Analytics data. There are three main types of functions in wpa:
    (i) Standard functions create a ggplot visual or a summary table based on a specific
    Workplace Analytics metric; (2) Report Generation functions generate HTML reports on
    a specific analysis area, e.g. Collaboration; (3) Other miscellaneous functions cover
    more specific applications (e.g. Subject Line text mining) of Workplace Analytics data.
    This package adheres to tidyverse principles and works well with the pipe syntax.
    wpa is built with the beginner-to-intermediate R users in mind, and is optimised for
    simplicity.
