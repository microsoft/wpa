This report contains a full **Information Value (IV)** Analysis. IV is a data exploration technique that helps identify which columns in a data set have predictive power or influence on the value of a specified dependent variable. This approach is useful to determine which Workplace Analytics Metrics are correlated to a specific outcome variable.

Among other things, this report should allow analysts to answer:

* What collaboration habits explain positive / negative answers to questions in an engagement survey?

* What collaboration habits differentiate top-performers from low-performers?

* What collaboration habits distinguish members from a specific group to others?
