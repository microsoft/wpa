Metric ,Definition
Workweek Span,"The time between the person's first sent email, meeting attended, or Teams call or chat, and the last email, meeting, call, or chat for each day of the work week. The total number of hours are based on the person’s work week that is set in Outlook, which the user can change at any time. If a work week is not defined in Outlook (or if Workplace Analytics is unable to access a user's Outlook settings), the totals are based on the default of Monday through Friday, with a minimum of four hours and a maximum of 16 hours per day. If reported for the week, the metric is a sum of the daily values for the week. If reported for the month, the metric is the sum of the daily values for the month."

The active hours of employees are measured. A week is considered flexible on this metric If the first active hour of the day differs from the start time input into the report for at least one day in the week, 

The percentage represents the percentage of time an employee is able to be flexible with their start times. "
Control Active Hours,"Members who choose alternative arrangements should be able to maintain a workload that is broadly equivalent to those that follow standard arrangements. This means that employees should be able to maintain the same active hours as the standard hours, and not regularly exceed the standard hours. 

The calculation looks at the number of hours that is expected for a person to be working from the start and end times input into the report. A week is considered flexible if the actice hours for all 5 days out of the week do not exceed the expected standard hours. 

The percentage represents the percentage of time an employee is able to control their active hours. "

Recurrent disconnection time is when the same hour(s) are inactive all 5 days of the week. An hour is inactive if there was no email or instant message sent during the hour. The week is considered flexibled if recurrent disconnection time is present.
