# Introduction

Welcome to the Analyst Guide of the **wpa** R package. This document will guide you through the installation process, explain the package functionality and structure, and get you comfortable with some common functions for analysis.

## Before we begin...

Make sure you have:
1.  Analyst access to [Workplace Analytics](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/workplace-analytics)
2.  [R](https://www.r-project.org/) installed in your local device. 

An IDE is optional, but we recommend either [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Why use R for Workplace Analytics?

There are multiple reasons:

1. **Cutting edge data science**: R is an open-source language that is known for its active user community and a wide range of packages that together enable the quick and effective implementation of data science techniques.
2. **Reproducibility**: Code-based workflows help facilitate reproducible analysis, which is the notion that analysis should be built in a way that is replicable by others. R as a tool promotes this good practice. 
3. **Efficiency / scalability**: R scales relatively well in the context of large datasets. The application of functions and automated processes also help cut down routine analysis time 
4. **Integration**: If you already use R as part of your analysis toolkit, adopting this package as part of the workflow will be seamless and easy
5. **Extensibility**: One of the most appealing feature of R is the access it offers to a wide range of packages. For instance, clustering and text mining can be done very easily as part of a R workflow – which are both available in this package
